# Livestream

Use this setup when a PUDA machine host has one or more USB cameras, webcams, or IP cameras and you want live video available over RTSP, RTMP, HLS, or WebRTC.

This guide assumes Docker Engine and Docker Compose are installed, and that the host can be reached by operators over the same VPN network used for PUDA.

## Setup Steps

1. Find the camera device or IP camera URL.

   For local USB cameras or webcams, list the video devices on the livestream host:

   ```bash
   ls -l /dev/video*
   ```

   If `v4l-utils` is installed, inspect the cameras:

   ```bash
   v4l2-ctl --list-devices
   ```

   Choose the device paths to expose, such as `/dev/video0` or `/dev/video2`.

   For IP cameras, find the stream URL from the camera admin UI or vendor docs. RTSP URLs usually look like:

   ```text
   rtsp://user:pass@192.168.1.50:554/stream1
   ```

2. Clone this repository.

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd livestream
   ```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the host address.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit `.env` and set `MTX_WEBRTCADDITIONALHOSTS` to the address operators will use to reach this host, usually the Tailscale IP or DNS name:

   ```env
   MTX_WEBRTCADDITIONALHOSTS=100.64.0.10
   ```

4. Update `streams.conf`.

   Each non-blank, non-comment line defines one stream: the input and the public stream name, separated by whitespace.

   ```text
   /dev/video0 livestream
   rtsp://user:pass@192.168.1.50:554/stream1 ipcam0
   ```

   The input can be a local `/dev/video*` device or an IP camera URL.

5. Update `compose.yml` to add local `/dev` devices.

   Docker containers do not automatically see host video devices. Each local camera used in `streams.conf` must also be exposed to the `ffmpeg` container with a matching `devices:` entry in `compose.yml`.

   ```yaml
   devices:
     - /dev/video0:/dev/video0
     - /dev/video2:/dev/video2
   ```

   IP camera URLs do not need a Docker device mapping.

6. Start the livestream services.

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   Check that both services are running:

   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```

## Stream URLs

The livestream will be available on the ports published by `compose.yml`:

```yaml
ports:
  - "8554:8554" # RTSP
  - "1935:1935" # RTMP
  - "8888:8888" # HLS
  - "8889:8889" # WebRTC HTTP/WHIP/WHEP
  - "8189:8189/udp" # WebRTC ICE/UDP
  - "8189:8189/tcp" # WebRTC ICE/TCP
```

Video feeds can be accessed at these URLs. For each stream name in `streams.conf`, replace `STREAM_NAME` and use the host from `MTX_WEBRTCADDITIONALHOSTS` in `.env`:

| Protocol | URL |
| --- | --- |
| RTSP | `rtsp://MTX_WEBRTCADDITIONALHOSTS:8554/STREAM_NAME` |
| RTMP | `rtmp://MTX_WEBRTCADDITIONALHOSTS:1935/STREAM_NAME` |
| HLS | `http://MTX_WEBRTCADDITIONALHOSTS:8888/STREAM_NAME/` |
| WebRTC | `http://MTX_WEBRTCADDITIONALHOSTS:8889/STREAM_NAME/` |

With the example `streams.conf`, `livestream` is available at those URLs.

## Troubleshooting

View logs if a stream does not appear:

```bash
docker compose logs -f mediamtx ffmpeg
```

From another machine that can reach the livestream host, verify a stream:

```bash
ffprobe rtsp://MTX_WEBRTCADDITIONALHOSTS:8554/livestream
```

For browser viewing, open the HLS or WebRTC URL.
